Hello, world! I am a plaintext yet, preparing to be encrypted. Initially, cryptography studied information encryption methods a reversible transformation of open source text based on a secret algorithm or key into an encrypted text ciphertext. Traditional cryptography forms a section of symmetric cryptosystems in which encryption and decryption is performed using the same secret key. In addition to this section, modern cryptography includes asymmetric cryptosystems, digital signature systems EDS, hash functions, key management, obtaining hidden information, quantum cryptography.
